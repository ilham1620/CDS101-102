## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

    a. First nisted sentence.
    b. Second nisted sentence.
    
2.  What if we contine the numbers this way?
    *   What happens if we indent using stars? it creates bullets with empty small circle.
    *   Let's add another one for good measure.
        *   Can we get another level of nesting? Yes, this is awesome.
